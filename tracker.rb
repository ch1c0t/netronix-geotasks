  # Coordinates have to be reversed because the order specified
  # in the task's description is [latitude, longtitude],
  # which is the opposite to the Mongoid::Geospatial order.

  # Get all the tasks sorted by the nearness to the driver's location.

  # As specified, it works with JSON data in the request's body,

  driver get { Task.near json['location'].reverse }

  # Create a new task.

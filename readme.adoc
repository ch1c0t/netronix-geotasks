= Geo based tasks tracker

This repository contains https://github.com/netronixgroup/backend-ruby[a test task from Netronix] implemented by Anatoly Chernow(chertoly@gmail.com).

== Dependencies

  $ bundle

And MongoDB should be listening at the default port:

  $ mongod --dbpath /path/to/directory --bind_ip 127.0.0.1

== Usage
The main file is `tracker.rb`. A rack app can be instantiated with `Tracker.new`.

== Testing
Instead of using more conventional rack-test, I use my own tool -- https://github.com/ch1c0t/hobby-test[hobby-test].
A big advantage of it is language-agnosticism. The service can be reimplemented in other language(for example, Elixir), and be tested against the same specification.
Hobby-test is still under development though. Your input on how it might be improved would be greatly appreciated.

To run the specs:

  $ bundle exec rspec
